Fast Backtrace Symbols Library

GIT:
        https://github.com/IcebrakerCZ/FastBacktraceSymbols.git

NOTES:
        Library providing the same functionality like GLibc `backtrace_symbols`
        call but many times faster and with demangled symbol names.

        Tested the performance on my server where called GLibc backtrace
        and GLlibc backtrace_symbols vs. Fast backtrace_symbols:


        Measured backtrace_symbols calls only:

            Fast    ~  287 ms for 1 million calls.
            GLibc   ~ 4761 ms for 1 million calls.


        Measured (backtrace + backtrace_symbols + free) calls altogether:

            Fast    ~ 4265 ms for 1 million calls.
            GLibc   ~ 8843 ms for 1 million calls.
